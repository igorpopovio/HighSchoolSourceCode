# My Old Source Code (from high school)

This repository contains the **first code I have ever written** (between `2005` and `2008`). Obviously, it's **full of the worst practices** since I had no idea what I was doing at that time. The curriculum included data structures and algorithms.

This nice image explains it all, so **don't judge me**!

Since then I have read a lot of software development books, but **the one** that influenced me most is **Clean Code** by Robert C. Martin (aka Uncle Bob).
